Adventure Game
--------------

**Plot**

You are **Frank** and you were just screwing around with **Vampirella** at her place while her husband, **Dracula**, was in a business trip. But just as you were getting some sweet action, he turns back home and his Bat minions steal most of your clothes and hide them around the castle. Luckly you were wearing your favorite shirt on you at the time, so you need to recover your belongings quick and sneak out. There is a good part at least: everytime he comes back from the trip, first thing he does is locking himself in the john to take a dump. Good luck!

**Jam**

This is the first game that I coded myself and worked with a graphics guy (**Banskel**) and a sound guy (**MarcStraight**) on it, but it's not quite finished, we got a bit distracted and the project requires more work on the actual gameplay itself, none the less, we'll put more time into it, so follow up, you won't be disapointed ;-) Inspired by Spike in Transylvania.

Part of the #indiesvspewdiepie jam, it's actually my first game dev jam ever. I should have done this sort of thing a long time ago, it was an awesome experience that I'm looking forward to again once in a while :-) It was really exciting and I managed to push my limits.
